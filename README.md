# Maze-Game
A small game that I'm making to learn more about Java/programming

I've been working on this on and off for about 6 months. A lot of the time has been spent trying to learn new stuff, so progress has been slow. 

Today (11/11) I finally decided to upload it to Github. Keep in mind that this is still very unfinished. I'm not sure what else to say...
