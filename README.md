# Maze-Game
A small game that I'm making to learn more about Java/programming

I've been working on this on and off for about 6 months. A lot of the time has been spent trying to learn new stuff, so progress has been slow. 

11/11/2017 I finally decided to upload it to Github. Keep in mind that this is still very unfinished. I'm not sure what else to say...

02/01/2018 Restructured the entire project to more closely align to the MVC model. Ignore everything inside src/ but outside src/folder. Those are the pre-restructuring files, and Git doesn't recognize that the current files are mostly variations of those (although the changes are pretty significant). I'll eventually figure out how to delete them. (Or I'll just leave them there to confuse you, or as relics.)
